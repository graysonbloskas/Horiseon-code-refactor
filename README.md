# code-refractor
## Purpose
I was instructed to take an existing code base, inlcuding html and css style sheet, and clean it up. Originally, there were multiple lines of css that could be condensed. This required changing semantics in the html and styling the page properly in css, as well as added multiple accessibility properties to bring the code up to standard. My changes, as well as a screenshot of the live site, are added to this readme. 
### Actions
#### Header
* created a header tag in html
* created a navbar in the header
* fixed a broken link for the "Search Engine Optimization" in the navbar by adding an id tag to the corresponding section on the page.
#### Accessibility
* brought the hero (background image) up to accessibility standards by adding a span tag, and giving it an img role, with an ARIA message. 
* adding alt= tags to all site images and icons
#### Clean Up
* Changed the div class "content" to section class "content"
* added  "class comlumn" under the aforementioned section, because there was originally 3 css tags for each column. 
* Changed the div class "benefits" to section class "benefits" 
* added "class benefit-specs" under the aforementioned section, because there was originally 3 css tags for each paragraph, icon, and title on the side bar.
